## My Vim Setup

This is my vim setup. It uses vim's native package manager.
You can use ```:h packages``` in vim to read more about the native package manager.

### What's Included

These are just some simple plugins I made to learn vimscript and make my life a little easier. 
Most of these features are done better with other plugins but I felt the full plugins 
were always overkill. So I came up with these.

* [elyk][2] - my colorscheme
* [packbro][3] - simple plugin installer
* [replaced][4] - shortcut for string replacement in the current buffer
* [commentator][6] - toggle comments
* [fontbro][7] - quickly switches between a list of fonts
* [grepbro][8] - run a vimgrep on the word under the cursor
