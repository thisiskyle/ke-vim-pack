## My Vim Setup

This is my vim setup. It uses vim's native package manager.
You can use ```:h packages``` in vim to read more about the native package manager.

### What's Included

These are just some simple plugins I made to learn vimscript and make my life a little easier. 
Most of these features are done better with other plugins but I felt the full plugins 
were always overkill. So I came up with these.

* [elyk][2] - colorscheme
* [vimpack][3] - simple plugin installer
* [replaced][4] - shortcut for simple string replacement in the current buffer
* [commentator][6] - toggles comments, filetypes are limited but more can easily be added
